Codon Count
Write a program to find out how many times each codon occurs in a strand of DNA based on
reading frames. A strand of DNA is made up of the symbols C, G, T, and A. A codon is three
consecutive symbols in a strand of DNA such as ATT or TCC. A reading frame is a way of
dividing a strand of DNA into consecutive codons. Consider the following strand of DNA =
“CGTTCAAGTTCAA”.
There are three reading frames.
● The first reading frame starts at position 0 and has the codons: “CGT”, “TCA”, “AGT” and
“TCA”. Here TCA occurs twice and the others each occur once.
● The second reading frame starts at position 1 (ignoring the first C character) and has the
codons: “GTT”, “CAA”, “GTT”, “CAA”. Here both GTT and CAA occur twice.
● The third reading frame starts at position 2 (ignoring the first two characters CG) and has
the codons: “TTC”, “AAG”, “TTC”. Here TTC occurs twice and AAG occurs once.
A map of DNA codons to the number times each codon appears in a reading frame would be
helpful in solving this problem.
Specifically, you should do the following:
● Create a new class for this problem
● Create a private variable to store a HashMap to map DNA codons to their count.
● Write a constructor to initialize the HashMap variable.
● Write a void method named buildCodonMap that has two parameters, an int named
start and a String named dna . This method will build a new map of codons mapped to
their counts from the string dna with the reading frame with the position start (a value of
0, 1, or 2). You will call this method several times, so be sure to make your map is empty
before building it.
● Write a method named getMostCommonCodon that has no parameters. This method
returns a String, the codon in a reading frame that has the largest count. If there are

several such codons, return any one of them. This method assumes the HashMap of
codons to counts has already been built.
● Write a void method named printCodonCounts that has two int parameters, start and
end . This method prints all the codons in the HashMap along with their counts if their
count is between start and end , inclusive.
● Write a tester method that prompts the user for a file that contains a DNA strand (could
be upper or lower case letters in the file, convert them all to uppercase, since case
should not matter). Then for each of the three possible reading frames, this method
○ builds a HashMap of codons to their number of occurrences in the DNA strand
○ prints the total number of unique codons in the reading frame
○ prints the most common codon and its count
○ prints the codons and their number of occurrences for those codons whose
number of occurrences in this reading frame are between two numbers inclusive
For example, for the string above and here: “CGTTCAAGTTCAA,” also in smalldna.txt ,
if we run our program and print the output requested above and specify to print codons and
counts for those codons whose counts are between 1 and 5 inclusive, we might get the output:
Reading frame starting with 0 results in 3 unique codons
and most common codon is TCA with count 2
Counts of codons between 1 and 5 inclusive are:
CGT 1
TCA 2
AGT 1
Reading frame starting with 1 results in 2 unique codons
and most common codon is CAA with count 2
Counts of codons between 1 and 5 inclusive are:
CAA 2

GTT 2
Reading frame starting with 2 results in 2 unique codons
and most common codon is TTC with count 2
Counts of codons between 1 and 5 inclusive are:
TTC 2
AAG 1
Note: The convention for text files is to end with a line break, so the above DNA string will have
length 13 if directly defined as a String in your tester method, but length 14 if the text file
containing it is read in as a FileResource. You can deal with this in several ways. One is to use
the String method .trim() ( http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#trim() )
to get rid of white space. Another way to guard against identifying the final “AA “ as a codon
would be adding a check that requires the last element of each codon be a letter before adding
to the codon map.
